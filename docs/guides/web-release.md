## Web Release

The Web release is distributed as a ZIP containing the compiled MyBookshelf application.

### Download

Download the `MyBookshelf-web-vX.Y.Z.zip` file from the project's GitHub Release.

The Web ZIP is a compiled application. You do not need to install the project's dependencies or run `pnpm install` to use it.

### Run the Web application locally

After downloading the ZIP:

1. Extract `MyBookshelf-web-vX.Y.Z.zip`.
2. Open the extracted folder.
3. Confirm that the folder contains `index.html` and the `assets` directory.
4. Open PowerShell in that folder.
5. Start a local Web server using one of the methods below.

#### Using Node.js

Node.js is required for this method.

Run:

```bash
npx serve .
```

If `serve` is not available, `npx` may ask for permission to install the package. Confirm with `Y`.

Open the address displayed in the terminal. It will normally be:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

Keep the terminal open while using MyBookshelf.

To stop the server, press `Ctrl + C`.

#### Using Python

If Python is already installed, run:

```bash
python -m http.server 3000
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

If the `python` command is not available, try:

```bash
py -m http.server 3000
```

Keep the terminal open while using MyBookshelf.

To stop the server, press `Ctrl + C`.

### Important

Do not open `index.html` directly with a double-click.

Opening the application through a `file://` address can prevent some browser resources from working correctly. MyBookshelf should be opened through a local Web server using an `http://localhost` address.

### Data and privacy

The Web ZIP contains the compiled application, but it does not automatically contain a personal book library, reading history, or files imported by another user.

Local application data is stored independently on the device/browser. Copying the ZIP to another computer does not transfer the data.

A future export, backup, or synchronization feature will be required to transfer local application data between devices.

### Using the ZIP on another computer

The other computer needs:

- a modern Web browser such as Chrome, Edge, or Firefox;
- the Web ZIP extracted to a local folder;
- a local Web server using Node.js, Python, or an equivalent tool.

The project's development dependencies are not required to run the compiled Web release.
